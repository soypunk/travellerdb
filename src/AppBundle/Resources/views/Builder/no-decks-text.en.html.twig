<h1>What, no deck?</h1>

<p>
	Decks are awesome. You can <span class="fake-inline-button text-primary"><span class="fa fa-pencil"></span> Edit</span> them until you're satisfied,
	then <span class="fake-inline-button text-primary"><span class="fa fa-share"></span> Publish</span> them for others to discuss.
	And if you want to keep to yourself, you can still <span class="fake-inline-button text-primary"><span class="fa fa-download"></span> Download</span> them or
	<span class="fake-inline-button text-primary"><span class="fa fa-clipboard"></span> Export</span> them.
</p>

<p>
	So what are you waiting for? To create your first deck, you can either <span class="fake-inline-button text-primary"><span class="fa fa-plus"></span> Build</span> one from scratch using the Deckbuilder,
	<span class="fake-inline-button text-primary"><span class="fa fa-upload"></span> Import</span> one from the web,
	or <span class="fake-inline-button text-primary"><span class="fa fa-upload"></span> Upload</span> a deck file in Octgn or simple text format.
