<p>This document is intended as the definitive source for rules information, but does not teach players how to play the game. Players should first read the <strong><i>Traveller Customizable Card Game Rules Booklet 2.0</i></strong> in its entirety and use this Rules Reference as needed while playing the game. The most current rules can be found in the <a href="https://www.travellerccg.com/downloads/">Downloads and Support</a> section of the <a herf="https://www.travellerccg.com/">Traveller CCG website</a></p>
<p>The majority of this guide consists of the glossary, which provides an alphabetical listing of terms and situations a player might encounter during a game. This section should be the first destination for players who have a rules question.</p>
<p>The latter part of this guide contains two appendices. The first appendix provides detailed timing diagrams that illustrate the structure of an entire game round, as well as a detailed explanation on how to handle each game step presented in those diagrams. The second provides a detailed anatomy of each cardtype.</p>

<h2 id="Background">Background</h2>
<p>The <strong><i>Traveller Customizable Card Game</i></strong> is set in the Third Imperium, an interstellar empire of more than 10,000 member worlds thriving in the distant future. Each player assumes the role of a starship captain at the head of a modest vessel and a small, adventurous crew, in search of riches and adventure.</p>


<h2 id="Game_Overview">Game Overview</h2>
<p><strong><i>Traveller</i></strong> has been designed to accommodate between one to four players (“Captains”).  Each captain requires a 20 card Adventure Deck, a 60 card Captain’s Deck, and a single Ship (<span class="icon-ship"></span>) card.</p>

<h2 id="Victory">Victory</h2>
<p>The objective of the game is to be the first captain to reach 20 Victory Points (<span class="icon icon-victorypoint"></span>).  Captains must also avoid Bankruptcy, which occurs if a captain incurs an expense and is unable to pay for it.  Bankruptcy results in defeat, even if the captain is ahead in <span class="icon icon-victorypoint"></span> when insolvent.  If all opposing captains have been eliminated, the remaining captain is the winner.</p>

<h2 id="The_Golden_Rule_and_The_Platinum_Rules">The Golden Rule and The Platinum Rules</h2>
<p></p>

<h3 id="The_Golden_Rule">The Golden Rule</h3>
<p>Card text can override any game rule except the Platinum Rule. If any card’s text conflicts with the basic game rules, the card’s language prevails, but only to the minimum extent necessary to resolve the effect. When determining a conflict between a card that says it does something and another card that says something “cannot” occur, “cannot” prevails. </p>

<h3 id="The_Platinum_Rule">The Platinum Rule</h3>
<p>Cards may never change ownership.  Within the course of a game, control of a card may change, but the owner will always be the captain who brought the card to the game.  When a captain is eliminated, all cards owned by the vanquished captain are removed from the game, even if they are controlled by, or attached to cards controlled by, another captain. </p>

</br>

<h1 id="Glossary">Glossary</h1>
<p>The following is a list of terms, concepts, and rules used in the <strong><i>Traveller Customizable Card Game.</i></strong></p>

<h3 id="Ability">Ability</h3>
<p>Any effect generated by card text on a permanent.</p>

<h3 id="Attach">Attach</h3>
<p>Attach creates a special relationship between two cards, binding them together. Attaching cards enter play by joining with another card currently in play (the “foundation card”), and remain in play unless removed by some effect or upon the removal from play of the foundation card.
<p>While the removal of the foundation card from play will always cause any attached cards to leave play, the inverse is not true, and the attached cards can be removed from play without impacting the foundation.</p>
<p>Attaching cards maintain distinct game states, and can be targeted, affected, <span class="icon icon-ready"></span>, or <span class="icon icon-exert"></span> and removed from play independently of the foundation card.</p>

<h3 iid="Attribute">Attribute</h3>
<p>An attribute is a value on a card with a specific in-game effect. Each card type has its own set of attributes, further described in the card anatomy section of the Play Guide.</p>

<h3 id="Cancel">Cancel</h3>
<p>An effect that cancels another effect prevents the second effect from occurring. Cancelling a card played still means the card is played, it just will not produce an effect. Cancelling an effect or a card played does not prevent costs from being paid.</p>

<h3 id="Discard_card">Discard (card)</h3>
<p>The act of moving cards from hand to the discard pile.  It does not include moving cards from the top of one’s deck to the discard pile to meet an expense (see Expend).  It also does not include moving cards in play to the discard pile (see Jettison).  Only captain’s cards can be discarded, as adventure cards are never part of a hand.</p>

<h3 id="Discard_token">Discard (token)</h3>
<p>Removing tokens from the Resource Pool.</p>

<h3 id="Disperse">Disperse</h3>
<p>When an effect directs a player to disperse a card, the card is set aside and is no longer part of the game. Except for <span class="icon icon-ship"></span>, any card type can be dispersed, including both adventure cards and captain’s cards.  Cards that are removed from the game because the owning captain has been eliminated are not dispersed, and do not trigger any text that references disperse.</p>

<h3 id="Disperesd_Region">Dispersed Region</h3>
<p>The dispersed region is an out-of-game location used to store dispersed cards. Any card in the dispersed region is no longer in the game, and isn’t subject to any effect unless that effect specifically indicates it affects dispersed cards.</p>

<h3 id="Effect">Effect</h3>
<p>An effect is any card text with in game consequences. Effects enter the queue (see Appendix I: Timing).</p>

<h3 id="Keywords_Overview">Keywords</h3>
<p>Keywords are abilities represented by a single term. Using keywords saves space and ensures that the same ability works the same way across multiple cards. Keywords are represented by bolded and underlined text.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Armor"><strong><u>Armor (X)</u></strong></h4>
<p>For each point of <strong><u><a href="#KW_Armor">Armor</a></u></strong>, reduce <span class="icon icon-wound"></span> inflicted from each source by one.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Armor_Penetration"><strong><u>Armor Penetration (X)</u></strong></h4>
<p>For each point of <strong><u><a href="#KW_Armor_Penetration">Armor Penetration</a></u></strong> possessed by a wounding source, reduce the effectiveness of <strong><u><a href="#KW_Armor">Armor</a></u></strong> by one.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Cash"><strong><u>Cash</u></strong></h4>
<p>When playing cards with this keyword, Captains may only expend cards from their hand to pay the card’s cost.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Concealed"><strong><u>Concealed (X)</u></strong></h4>
<p>For each point of <strong><u><a href="#KW_Concealed">Concealed</a></u></strong>, increase the cost opposing captains must pay to target the concealed card by one.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Countermeasure"><strong><u>Countermeasure (trait )</u></strong></h4>
<p>A <strong><u><a href="#KW_Hardened">Hardened</a></u></strong> source with this keyword ignores any <strong><u><a href="#KW_Critical">Critical</a></u></strong> from a damaging source with the corresponding specified <strong><i>trait</i></strong>.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Critical"><strong><u>Critical (X)</u></strong></h4>
<p>For each point of <strong><u><a href="#KW_Critical">Critical</a></u></strong> possessed by a damaging source, reduce the effectiveness of <strong><u><a href="#KW_Hardened">Hardened</a></u></strong> by one.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Equity"><strong><u>Equity</u></strong></h4>
<p>When playing cards with this keyword, Captains may only expend cards from the top of their deck to pay the card’s cost.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Expendable"><strong><u>Expendable (X <span class="icon icon-expense"></span>)</u></strong></h4>
<p>A card with this keyword may be jettisoned to provide its <strong><u><a href="#KW_Expendable">Expendable</a></u></strong> value towards a pending Credits cost.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Hardened"><strong><u>Hardened (X)</u></strong></h4>
<p>For each point of <strong><u><a href="#KW_Hardened">Hardened</a></u></strong>, reduce <span class="icon icon-structure"></span> inflicted from each source by one.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Hindrance"><strong><u>Hindrance</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong><u><a href="#KW_Hindrance">Hindrance</a></u></strong> appears almost exclusively on cards meant to be played attached to a card controlled by an opponent, for a deleterious effect. Hindrances have both the <strong><u><a href="#KW_Integral">Integral</a></u></strong> and <strong><u><a href="#KW_Trifling">Trifling</a></u></strong> keywords. Additionally,<span class="icon icon-gear"></span> with <strong><u><a href="#KW_Hindrance">Hindrance</a></u></strong> may be played attached to a <span class="icon icon-crew"></span> controlled by an opposing captain, and <span class="icon icon-upgrade"></span> with <strong><u><a href="#KW_Hindrance">Hindrance</a></u></strong> may be played attached to an opposing captain’s <span class="icon icon-ship"></span>.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Huaniti"><strong><u>Humaniti</u></strong></h4>
<p>A <span class="icon icon-crew"></span> with this keyword counts as Human. This keyword will only be found on <span class="icon icon-crew"></span> with a <span class="icon icon-gene"></span> other than Human, and such <span class="icon icon-crew"></span> also remain non-Human. <strong><u><a href="#KW_Haumanit">Humaniti</a></u></strong> therefore qualify as both Human and non-Human.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Infamous"><strong><u>Infamous</u></strong></h4>
<p>While a card with this keyword is in play, its controlling captain is considered to have an additional <span class="icon icon-infamy"></span> token.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Integral"><strong><u>Integral</u></strong></h4>
<p>A card with <strong><u><a href="#KW_Integral">Integral</a></u></strong> may not be moved, except to an out of play area, such as the hand, deck, dispersed region, or discard pile.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Invulnerable"><strong><u>Invulnerable (to x)</u></strong></h4>
<p>Cards with <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> cannot be affected by effects or cards of a specified type. <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> will always be paired with a specific identifier describing the nature of the immunity. A card’s Invulnerability will never extend to abilities it itself generates.</p>
<p>If a card is <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> to an effect, that effect may not:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Target <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> cards.</li>
    <li>Cancel or modify an effect generated by <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> cards.</li>
    <li>Attach to an <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> card.</li>
    <li>Change the <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> card’s game state, <span class="icon icon-ready"></span> or <span class="icon icon-exert"></span> the card, or move the card.</li>
    <li>Inflict <span class="icon icon-wound"></span> or <span class="icon icon-structure"></span>, Jettison or Disperse the <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> card.</li>
    <li>Change any value or attribute on the <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> card.</li>
    <li>Include the <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> card in any count. The <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> card is invisible to the specified effect.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="KW_Mechanical"><strong><u>Mechanical</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong><u><a href="#KW_Mechanical">Mechanical</a></u></strong> <span class="icon icon-crew"></span> may not have <span class="icon icon-wound"></span> restored by crew abilities, <span class="icon icon-gear"></span> or <span class="icon icon-heroic"></span> unless the effect specifically indicates it will restore <span class="icon icon-wound"></span> to Mechanical <span class="icon icon-crew"></span>.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Reflec"><strong><u>Reflec</u></strong></h4>
<p>An <strong><u><a href="#KW_Armor">Armor</a></u></strong> source with this keyword ignores any <strong><u><a href="#KW_Armor_Penetration">Armor Penetration</a></u></strong> from a wounding source with <strong><i>Laser</i></strong>.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Replenish"><strong><u>Replenish (X)</u></strong></h4>
<p>For each point of <strong><u><a href="#KW_Replenish">Replenish</a></u></strong>, the effect’s controller moves a random card from their discard pile to the bottom of their deck. If instead the text states to “<strong><u><a href="#KW_Replenish">Replenish</a></u></strong> this card,” then rather than drawing a random card from the discard pile, the card with <strong><u><a href="#KW_Replenish">Replenish</a></u></strong> is moved to the bottom of the controller’s deck.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Resilient"><storng><u>Resilient</u></storng></h4>
<p>A <strong><u><a href="#KW_Resilient">Resilient</a></u></strong> card restores missing <span class="icon icon-wound"></span> or <span class="icon icon-structure"></span> during Stage 4 of the Ready Phase at no cost.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Restricted_Unrestricted"><strong><u>Restricted/Unrestrictd</u></strong></h4>
<p>Normally, a card with a given card title can only be included up to twice in an Adventure Deck or up to three times in a Captain’s Deck.  When a card has <strong><u><a href="#KW_Restricted_Unrestricted">Restricted (X)</a></u></strong>, it can only be included X number of times or fewer in the relevant deck.  So, <strong><u><a href="#KW_Restricted_Unrestricted">Restricted(2)</a></u></strong> for a Captain’s Deck card means at most two copies of that card in the Captain’s Deck. An <strong><u><a href="#KW_Restricted_Unrestricted">Unrestricted</a></u></strong> card may have any number of copies in a deck.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Trifling"><strong><u>Trifling</u></strong></h4>
<p>Trifling cards do not count against any limit restricting the number of cards a captain may have in play, and do not take up any slots. However, it still won’t permit a captain to control multiple <span class="icon icon-crew"></span> with the same name.</p>

<h3 id="Jettison">Jettison</h3>
<p>Move the jettisoned card from play to the discard pile.</p>

<h3 id="Limited">Limited</h3>
<p>A limited effect may only be generated once each round. Limited is depicted with the icon <span class="icon icon-limited"></span>.</p>

<h3 id="Look">Look</h3>
<p>Allows a captain to view a specified card (or cards) without revealing it (or them) to any other captain.</p>

<h3 id="Modifier">Modifier</h3>
<p>Any effect that increases or decreases any value of any card in play. Values in Traveller may be subject to either positive or negative modification. Fractional values are rounded up. Modifiers apply their full effect, even if that would reduce a value to less than zero. However, any value less than zero after all modifications have been applied counts as zero.</p>

<h3 id="Move">Move</h3>
<p>Alter the location of a card, between the play area, discard pile, deck, hand, or dispersed region.</p>

<h3 id="Native">Native</h3>
<p>Native refers to values, icons, text and attributes physically printed on the card.</p>

<h3 id="Non_Human">Non-Human</h3>
<p>A <span class="icon icon-crew"></span> as non-Human if their <span class="icon icon-gene"></span> any other than Human.</p>

<h3 id="Permanents">Permanents</h3>
<p>A permanent card has a persistent presence in the game play area, unless removed by an effect. <span class="icon icon-conn"></span>, <span class="icon icon-crew"></span>, <span class="icon icon-gear"></span>, <span class="icon icon-upgrade"></span> and <span class="icon icon-ship"></span> are all permanents

<h3 id="Restore">Restore</h3>
<p>Remove <span class="icon icon-wound"></span> from a <span class="icon icon-crew"></span> or <span class="icon icon-structure"></span> from an <span class="icon icon-upgrade"></span>.</p>

<h3 id="Search">Search</h3>
<p>When directed to search, a captain may select a card from the designated search location (typically either the captain’s or adventure decks or discard piles), reveal the selected card to all players, and then perform any further effects as may be pending.</p>

<h3 id="Target">Target</h3>
<p>Specifying the subject of an effect. Targeting is an explicit concept. If an effect does not state the word “target,” that effect does not target. When targeting is required, captains must choose a legal target, if able. If an effect cannot find a legal target, the effect fails.</p>

<h3 id="Timing_Overview">Timing</h3>
<p>In customizable card games, timing is the framework that determines the order in which effects occur. <strong><i>Traveller</i></strong> uses a LIFO system, Last In, First Out. Effects are resolved in reverse order in which they are played. LIFO can sound counter-intuitive, but as a mechanic it allows players the opportunity to respond to changing circumstances.
    <ul>
        <li><h4 id="The_Queue">The Queue</h4></li>
<p>Whenever a card is played or an effect generated, it enters the queue. The queue is cleared by resolving effects in reverse order in which they were played. Once a queue has been formed, only cards and effects with <span class="icon icon-reaction"></span> may be added to the queue.</p>
<p>Most queues will only have a single item, and resolve without any further issues. However, the queue becomes relevant when captains wish to respond to an effect or card play</p>
<li><h4 id="Activated_Effects">Activated Effects</h4></li>
<p>An activated effect is any effect that requires a cost to be payed or a card play to generate. All transient cards are activated effects. Permanents also have activated effects, in the form of abilities that require a cost.</p>
<p>Activated effects always go on the queue.</p>
<li><h4 id="Persistent_Effects">Persistent Effects</h4></li>
<p>An effect is persistent if it is generated by permanent cards from abilities that do not have a cost. Such effects are always active, unless subject to an unmet condition. Persistent effects do not enter the queue.</p>
<li><h4 id="Priority">Priority</h4></li>
<p>Priority identifies the captain with the initial opportunity to take an <span class="icon icon-reaction"></span>, generate an effect, or play a card. Generally, priority rests with the acting captain. During phase stages in which there is no acting captain (for instance, Stage 1 Ready Phase), if two or more captains wish to play a card or generate an effect, priority is assigned to the captain with the highest <span class="icon icon-initiative"></span>.</p>
<li><h4 id="Phase_Restrictions">Phase Restrictions</h4></li>
<p>Some effects may have certain limitations regarding the phase or phases in which they may be generated. These phase restrictions are displayed on the cards in blue outlined text. Any text below the phase restriction is subject to it.</p>
<li><h4 id="Timing_Indicator">Timing Indicator</h4></li>
<p>Text or icons preceding a dash (-) in a card’s text box determines an effect’s timing. There are two principle timing indicators in <strong><i>Traveller</i></strong>:
<ul>
    <li><span class="icon icon-action"></span>: This icon indicates that the effect is an action. <span class="icon icon-action"></span> may only be generated by the acting captain.</li>
    <li><psan class="icon icon-reaction"></psan> : This icon indicates that the effect is a reaction. Unlike other effects, <span class="icon icon-reaction"></span> may be generated at any time, including while another effect is being resolved. Unless otherwise specified, all <span class="icon icon-event"></span> cards are playable as <span class="icon icon-reaction"></span>.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>If an effect is not subject to either a phase restriction or <span class="icon icon-action"></span> the timing indicator, then it may be generated at any time, provided no other effect is pending. Only effects with <span class="icon icon-reaction"></span> timing may be played while another effect is on the queue.</p>
</ul>

<h3 id="Trait">Trait</h3>
<p>A trait is a special characteristic of a card that lacks an independent effect, but may be implicated by other effects that reference the trait. Traits are always represented with <strong><i>bolded italic</i></strong> text.</p>

<h3 id="Transient">Transient</h3>
<p>Transient cards have a temporary presence in the game play area, existing only long enough to resolve any effects they may generate, after which they are moved out of play (typically to the discard pile). <span class="icon icon-event"></span> and <span class="icon icon-heroic"></span> are transient card types.</p>
