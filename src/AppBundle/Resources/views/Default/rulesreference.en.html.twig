<p>This document is intended as the definitive source for rules information, but does not teach players how to play the game. Players should first read the <strong><i>Traveller Customizable Card Game Rules Booklet 2.0</i></strong> in its entirety and use this Rules Reference as needed while playing the game. The most current rules can be found in the <a href="https://www.travellerccg.com/downloads/">Downloads and Support</a> section of the <a herf="https://www.travellerccg.com/">Traveller CCG website</a></p>
<p>The majority of this guide consists of the glossary, which provides an alphabetical listing of terms and situations a player might encounter during a game. This section should be the first destination for players who have a rules question.</p>
<p>The latter part of this guide contains two appendices. The first appendix provides detailed timing diagrams that illustrate the structure of an entire game round, as well as a detailed explanation on how to handle each game step presented in those diagrams. The second provides a detailed anatomy of each cardtype.</p>

<h2 id="Background">Background</h2>
<p>The <strong><i>Traveller Customizable Card Game</i></strong> is set in the Third Imperium, an interstellar empire of more than 10,000 member worlds thriving in the distant future. Each player assumes the role of a starship captain at the head of a modest vessel and a small, adventurous crew, in search of riches and adventure.</p>


<h2 id="Game_Overview">Game Overview</h2>
<p><strong><i>Traveller</i></strong> has been designed to accommodate between one to four players (“Captains”).  Each captain requires a 20 card Adventure Deck, a 60 card Captain’s Deck, and a single Ship (<span class="icon-ship"></span>) card.</p>

<h2 id="Victory">Victory</h2>
<p>The objective of the game is to be the first captain to reach 20 Victory Points (<span class="victorypoint"></span>).  Captains must also avoid Bankruptcy, which occurs if a captain incurs an expense and is unable to pay for it.  Bankruptcy results in defeat, even if the captain is ahead in <span class="victorypoint"></span> when insolvent.  If all opposing captains have been eliminated, the remaining captain is the winner.</p>

<h2 id="The_Golden_Rule_and_The_Platinum_Rules">The Golden Rule and The Platinum Rules</h2>
<p></p>

<h3 id="The_Golden_Rule">The Golden Rule</h3>
<p>Card text can override any game rule except the Platinum Rule. If any card’s text conflicts with the basic game rules, the card’s language prevails, but only to the minimum extent necessary to resolve the effect. When determining a conflict between a card that says it does something and another card that says something “cannot” occur, “cannot” prevails. </p>

<h3 id="The_Platinum_Rule">The Platinum Rule</h3>
<p>Cards may never change ownership.  Within the course of a game, control of a card may change, but the owner will always be the captain who brought the card to the game.  When a captain is eliminated, all cards owned by the vanquished captain are removed from the game, even if they are controlled by, or attached to cards controlled by, another captain. </p>

</br>

<h1 id="Glossary">Glossary</h1>
<p>The following is a list of terms, concepts, and rules used in the <strong><i>Traveller Customizable Card Game.</i></strong></p>

<h3 id="Ability">Ability</h3>
<p>Any effect generated by card text on a permanent.</p>

<h3 id="Adventure_Deck">Adventure Deck</h3>
<p>An <a href="#Adventure_Deck">Adventure Deck</a> is comprised only of adventure cards, which have red backs.  Adventure cards are dual purpose, consisting of both a Contract (<span class="contract"></span>) and a Complication (<span class="complication"></span>). <span class="contract"></span> are opportunities to gain <span class="victorypoint"></span>. <span class="complication"></span> attach to and impede a Captain’s ability to complete the attached <span class="contract"></span>.  When an adventure card enters play, it does so only as either a <span class="contract"></span>or a <span class="complication"></span>, and it will retain that type so long as it persists, and cannot change between <span class="contract"></span> and <span class="complication"></span>.</p>
<p>The <a href="#Adventure_Deck">Adventure Deck</a> and the <a href="#Captains_Deck">Captain’s Deck</a> have separate discard piles. Discard piles are public knowledge.  Any captain may look at the contents of any discard pile.</p>
<p>When an Adventure Deck has no cards remaining and an adventure card draw is required, shuffle the <a href="#Adventure_Deck">Adventure Deck’s</a> discard pile to reform the <a href="#Adventure_Deck">Adventure Deck</a>.</p>
<p>You may not look through your <a href="#Adventure_Deck">Adventure Deck</a> or your <a href="#Captains_Deck">Captain’s Deck</a> after play has begun unless a card so directs.</p>
<p>When building a deck, a <a href="#Adventure_Deck">Adventure Deck</a> must contain 20 adventure cards and a maximum of two (2) of any one adventure card.</p>

<h3 id="Attach">Attach</h3>
<p>In <strong><em>Traveller</em></strong>, some cards will “attach” or become “attached” to another card. Attach creates a special relationship between two cards, binding them together. Attaching cards enter play by joining with another card currently in play (the “foundation card”), and remain in play unless removed by some effect or upon the removal from play of the foundation card.</p>
<p>While the removal of the foundation card from play will always cause any attached cards to leave play, the inverse is not true, and the attached cards can be removed from play without impacting the foundation.</p>
<p>Attaching cards maintain distinct game states, and can be targeted, affected, <span class="ready"></span>, or <span class="exert"></span> and removed from play independently of the foundation card.</p>

<h3 id="Attribute">Attribute</h3>
<p>An attribute is a value on a card with a specific in-game effect. Each card type has its own set of attributes, further described in the card anatomy section of the Play Guide.</p>

<h3 id="Bankruptcy">Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>A captain unable to meet an expense becomes Bankrupt. Because captains must meet expenses if able, as a practical matter, bankruptcy will only occur when there is a pending expense and no further cards in hand or in the Captain’s Deck are available to be expended.</p>
<p>A bankrupted captain is removed from the game, and any cards owned by that captain are also removed, even if under the control of another captain.  In a two-player game, bankruptcy results in a victory for the remaining captain, even if the solvent captain is behind in <span class="victorypoint"></span>.  If a captain becomes insolvent during a multi-player game, they are removed from play immediately, and the game resumes.</p>

<h3 id="Captains_Deck">Captain's Deck</h3>
<p>A <a href="#Captains_Deck">Captain’s Deck</a> is comprised of captain’s cards, which have blue backs.  The six types of captain’s cards are:  Connections (<span class="connection"></span>), Crew (<span class="crew"></span>), Gear (<span class="gear"></span>), Heroic Actions (<span class="heroics"></span>), Events (<span class="event"></span>), and Upgrades (<span class="upgrade"></span>). Unqualified references to cards, whether in these rules or in card text are always to be assumed to refer to captain’s cards. Similarly, unqualified references to “decks” or “discard pile” are assumed to refer to the <a href="#Captains_Deck">Captain’s Deck</a> and the captain’s discard pile, respectively.</p>
<p>When a <a href="#Captains_Deck">Captain’s Deck</a> has no cards remaining, do not shuffle its discard pile to reform the <a href="#Captains_Deck">Captain’s Deck</a>.</p>
<p>You may not look through your <a href="#Adventure_Deck">Adventure Deck</a> or your <a href="#Captains_Deck">Captain’s Deck</a> after play has begun unless a card so directs.</p>
<p>When building a deck, a <a href="#Captains_Deck">Captain's Deck</a> must contain 60 captain's cards and a maximum of three (3) of any one captain's card, unless specified differently on the card.</p>

<h3 id="Cancel">Cancel</h3>
<p>An effect that cancels another effect prevents the second effect from occurring. Cancelling a card played still means the card is played, it just will not produce an effect. Cancelling an effect or a card played does not prevent costs from being paid.</p>

<h3 id="Cards">Cards</h3>
<p>Cards in <strong><em>Traveller</em></strong> are divided into several different types, each with their own attributes and uses.  Each player will require one <span class="ship"></span> , a <a href="#Captains_Deck">Captain’s Deck</a> of sixty captain’s cards, and an <a href="#Adeventure_Deck">Adventure Deck</a> of twenty adventure cards. The <span class="ship"></span> represents both the captain and their vessel.  Unlike other cards, a captain’s <span class="ship"></span> may never be removed from play until bankruptcy or upon the game’s ultimate conclusion.</p>

<h3 id="Card_slots">Card Slots</h3
<p>Card slots constrain the number of certain card types that a captain may have in play.</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="crew"></span> and <span class="structure"></span> are limited by the slots provided by the captain’s <span class="ship"></span>.</li>
    <li><span class="crew"></span> may not have more than one attached  <span class="gear"></span> of the same subtype.</li>
    <li>Captains may not have more than one <span class="connection"></span> of the same subtype.</li>
    <li>A <span class="contract"></span> may not have more <span class="complication"></span> attached than its <span class="complication"></span> slots.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Contract_Slots">Contract Slots</h3>
<p>There are always four <span class="contract"></span> slots. Control of <span class="contract"></span> slots depends on the number of players in the game. Whenever a <span class="contract"></span> leaves play, the slot’s controller draws from their Adventure Deck and plays the card face up as a <span class="contract"></span>. They then draw another card and, without looking at it, attaches it to the <span class="contract"></span> face down as a <span class="complication"></span>.</p>
<p>If the number of captains in the game changes, for instance due to bankruptcy, the remaining captains follow the rules applicable to the new number of current participants.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed text-center">
    <tr class="bg-baratheon">
    <th>Number of Captains*</th><th>Contract Slots Controlled</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td><td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="bg-info">
        <td>3</td><td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td><td>1</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>*In a three-player game, each captain always controls one slot. The fourth slot is controlled by the captain with the lowest total <span class="victorypoint"></span>. If multiple captains have earned the same <span class="victorypoint"></span>, control passes to the captain with the highest Initiative (<span class="initiative"></span>). If these are tied, determine controller randomly.</p>
<p><strong><em>Solo Play</em></strong></p>
<p>Follow the set up as per standard rules. However, in solo play, the captain controls all four <span class="contract"></span> slots, so they will place four <span class="contract"></span>, each with an attached, face down, <span class="complication"></span>. Because <span class="complication"></span> are the primary obstacle in solo play, the <a href="#Adventure_Phase_Solo">Adventure Phase</a> has a number of important changes.</p>

<h3 id="Control_vs_Ownership">Control vs. Ownership</h3>
<p>Control and Ownership are two different concepts in <strong><em>Traveller</em></strong>. Captains own all cards that are included in their decks at the start of the game, as well as their <span class="ship"></span>. Note that ownership as a game concept is not tied to ownership in a legal sense.</p>
<p>By default, a captain controls all cards they bring into play. Control entitles a Captain to generate effects, trigger abilities, collect resource tokens, select variables and pay costs. During the course of a game, control of a card may change, but ownership may not.</p>

<h3 id="Cost">Cost</h3>
<p>Cost is an important concept in the <strong><em>Traveller Customizable Card Game</em></strong>. Playing a Captain’s Card requires paying the cost in Credits (<span class="1"></span>), which is printed in the upper left hand corner, by expending cards for their <span class="expense"></span>(see <a href="#Expenses">Expenses, Expend and Expense Value (EV / <span class="expense"></span> )</a>). A cost of <span class="0"></span> Credits does not require the expenditure of <span class="expense"></span>.</p>
<p>If a captain cannot pay all of the costs of playing a card, the captain cannot attempt to play it. Some effects in the game may modify the Credits cost to play a card or add a cost requirement other than Credits; in order for these effects to alter a cost, they must have already resolved before a captain attempts to play a card (or generate an effect, see below). Once costs are paid, they cannot be altered. All modifiers to costs are applied before determining final cost. Final Credit costs below <span class="0"></span> become <span class="0"></span>. Costs are not Queued.</p>
<p>Additionally, many cards have abilities that require a cost before they may be generated. Besides Credits, generating an ability may require other costs, such as <span class="exert"></span> a card. A captain can only attempt to generate an effect the captain can pay all of the costs for. Costs for abilities on cards in play are indicated by text and icons immediately preceding a colon.</p>
<p>Only the card’s controller may pay costs, and all costs must be met from cards under that captain’s control. When unspecified, a card refers to itself, so a cost to <span class="exert"></span> means <span class="exert"></span> the card generating the effect or a cost to jettison means jettison the card generating the effect.</p>
<p>Unless subject to a specific restriction, an effect may be generated multiple times, provided the cost can be met for each specific instance.</p>

<h3 id="Counter">Counter</h3>
<p>Counters are generated by or used to track specific effects, but have no independent agency, effect or ability outside that granted by a specific card.</p>
<p>Individual cards may assign names to counters. Whenever another card would add counters to a card that specifies a particular named counter, those additional counters have that name.</p>

<h3 id="Deck_Construction">Deck Construction</h3>
<p><strong><em>Traveller</em></strong> is a customizable card game, which means players create their decks using the entire universe of available cards. It is this element of deck construction that gives card games like <strong><em>Traveller</em></strong> a continuing appeal. Players are able to exercise creativity when making decks, basing them around particular mechanics, themes or aesthetics.</p>
<p>In order to play <strong><em>Traveller</em></strong>, each player must have exactly 1 ship card, an <a href="#Adventure_Deck">adventure deck</a> of 20 adventure cards, and a <a href="#Captains_Deck">captain’s deck</a> of 60 captain’s cards. No adventure card may appear more than twice in any captain’s adventure deck, and no captain’s card may appear more than three times in any captain’s deck.</p>

<h3 id="Deck_Discard_Pile">Deck/Discard Pile</h3>
<p>In <strong><em>Traveller</em></strong>, each player has their own <a href="#Adventure_Deck">Adventure Deck</a> and <a href="#Captains_Deck">Captain’s Deck</a>.  Adventure Cards will only ever be present in an Adventure Deck and Captain’s Cards will only ever be present in a Captain’s Deck.  Each deck has its own, separate discard pile. Discard piles are public knowledge. Any captain may look at the contents of any discard pile. A card will never go into a deck or discard pile of a player other than that of the owner of the card.</p>

<h3 id="Discard_card">Discard (card)</h3>
<p>The act of moving cards from hand to the discard pile.  It does not include moving cards from the top of one’s deck to the discard pile to meet an expense (see Expend).  It also does not include moving cards in play to the discard pile (see Jettison).  Only captain’s cards can be discarded, as adventure cards are never part of a hand.</p>

<h3 id="Discard_token">Discard (token)</h3>
<p>Removing tokens from the Resource Pool.</p>

<h3 id="Disperse">Disperse</h3>
<p>When an effect directs a player to disperse a card, the card is set aside and is no longer part of the game. Except for <span class="ship"></span>, any card type can be dispersed, including both adventure cards and captain’s cards.  Cards that are removed from the game because the owning captain has been eliminated are not dispersed, and do not trigger any text that references disperse.</p>

<h3 id="Disperesd_Region">Dispersed Region</h3>
<p>The dispersed region is an out-of-game location used to store dispersed cards. Any card in the dispersed region is no longer in the game, and isn’t subject to any effect unless that effect specifically indicates it affects dispersed cards.</p>

<h3 id="Effect">Effect</h3>
<p>An effect is any card text with in game consequences. Effects enter the queue (see Appendix I: Timing).</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="#Timing_Overview">Timing</a></p>

<h3 id="Exert">Exert (<span class="exert"></span>), and Exerted</h3>
<p>Ready and Exerted are two game states indicating a card’s availability for further use.  Only cards currently in play may be <span class="ready"></span> or <span class="exert"></span> , and only a ready card may <span class="extert"></span>, while only an exerted card may <span class="ready"></span>. Exerted cards are rotated 90 degress from thier ready state. Exerted abilities may not be used until the card is <span class="ready"></span>.</p>

<h3 id="Expenses">Expenses, Expend, and Expense Value (EV / <span class="expense"></span>)</h3>
<p>Captains will incur Expenses.  An expense must be met by expending captain’s cards for Expense Value (<span class="expense"></span>).  Once an expense has been incurred, a captain must attempt to meet it by expending cards from hand or off the top of their captain’s deck, in any combination the player may desire. Expended cards are moved to the discard pile.  Captains may not fail to meet an expense, and if they incur an expense that cannot be met, they become <a href="#Bankruptcy">Bankrupt</a>.</p>
<p><span class="expense"></span> may not be split between multiple expenses.  If a card provides 3<span class="expense"></span>, it cannot be used as 1 for one expense and 2 for a second expense.  However, multiple cards can (and, if necessary, must) be expended to combine their values to meet a single expense.</p>

<h3 id="Hand_Size">Hand Size</h3>
<p>Each player has a hand of cards. By default, all captains have a maximum hand size of seven (7).  Only captain’s cards are ever in your hand.  Cards in hand must be concealed from other players.  You may always look at your own cards in hand.</p>
<p>You may not look through your <a href="#Adventure_Deck">Adventure Deck</a> or your <a href="#Captains_Deck">Captain’s Deck</a> after play has begun unless a card so directs.</p>

<h3 id="Jack_of_all_Trades">Jack-of-all-Trades</h3>
<p>Jack-of-all-Trades is slightly different from the other skills. It does not have a token of its own. Instead, a <span class="crew"></span> with Jack-of-all-Trades (<span class="jack"></span>) at the trained (hex) level may collect any other trained skill token except Psionic (<span class="psionic"></span> ). Additionally, a <span class="crew"></span> with Jack-of-all-Trades may not select a token corresponding to another trained skill that <span class="crew"></span> possesses.</p>
<p>A <span class="jack"></span> with Jack-of-all-Trades (<span class="jack"></span>) at the expert (circle) level may collect any two trained skill tokens (subject to the above limitations), but the tokens must come from two different skills.</p>
<p>Jack-of-all-Trades is a partial exception to the rule that tokens are generated automatically.</p>
<p>During Stage 1 of the <a href="#Resource_Phase">Resource Phase</a>, the controlling captain must announce which tokens they wish to collect from any <span class="crew"></span> with Jack-of-all-Trades. A captain who neglects this requirement is forbidden from collecting tokens for the undeclared Jack-of-allTrades skill that phase.</p>

<h3 id="Keywords_Overview">Keywords</h3>
<p>Keywords are abilities represented by a single term. Using keywords saves space and ensures that the same ability works the same way across multiple cards. Keywords are represented by bolded and underlined text.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Armor"><strong><u>Armor (X)</u></strong></h4>
<p>For each point of <strong><u><a href="#KW_Armor">Armor</a></u></strong>, reduce <span class="wound"></span> inflicted from each source by one.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Armor_Penetration"><strong><u>Armor Penetration (X)</u></strong></h4>
<p>For each point of <strong><u><a href="#KW_Armor_Penetration">Armor Penetration</a></u></strong> possessed by a wounding source, reduce the effectiveness of <strong><u><a href="#KW_Armor">Armor</a></u></strong> by one.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Cash"><strong><u>Cash</u></strong></h4>
<p>When playing cards with this keyword, Captains may only expend cards from their hand to pay the card’s cost.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Concealed"><strong><u>Concealed (X)</u></strong></h4>
<p>For each point of <strong><u><a href="#KW_Concealed">Concealed</a></u></strong>, increase the cost opposing captains must pay to target the concealed card by one.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Countermeasure"><strong><u>Countermeasure (trait )</u></strong></h4>
<p>A <strong><u><a href="#KW_Hardened">Hardened</a></u></strong> source with this keyword ignores any <strong><u><a href="#KW_Critical">Critical</a></u></strong> from a damaging source with the corresponding specified <strong><i>trait</i></strong>.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Critical"><strong><u>Critical (X)</u></strong></h4>
<p>For each point of <strong><u><a href="#KW_Critical">Critical</a></u></strong> possessed by a damaging source, reduce the effectiveness of <strong><u><a href="#KW_Hardened">Hardened</a></u></strong> by one.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Equity"><strong><u>Equity</u></strong></h4>
<p>When playing cards with this keyword, Captains may only expend cards from the top of their deck to pay the card’s cost.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Expendable"><strong><u>Expendable (X <span class="expense"></span>)</u></strong></h4>
<p>A card with this keyword may be jettisoned to provide its <strong><u><a href="#KW_Expendable">Expendable</a></u></strong> value towards a pending Credits cost.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Hardened"><strong><u>Hardened (X)</u></strong></h4>
<p>For each point of <strong><u><a href="#KW_Hardened">Hardened</a></u></strong>, reduce <span class="structure"></span> inflicted from each source by one.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Hindrance"><strong><u>Hindrance</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong><u><a href="#KW_Hindrance">Hindrance</a></u></strong> appears almost exclusively on cards meant to be played attached to a card controlled by an opponent, for a deleterious effect. Hindrances have both the <strong><u><a href="#KW_Integral">Integral</a></u></strong> and <strong><u><a href="#KW_Trifling">Trifling</a></u></strong> keywords. Additionally,<span class="gear"></span> with <strong><u><a href="#KW_Hindrance">Hindrance</a></u></strong> may be played attached to a <span class="crew"></span> controlled by an opposing captain, and <span class="upgrade"></span> with <strong><u><a href="#KW_Hindrance">Hindrance</a></u></strong> may be played attached to an opposing captain’s <span class="ship"></span>.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Huaniti"><strong><u>Humaniti</u></strong></h4>
<p>A <span class="crew"></span> with this keyword counts as Human. This keyword will only be found on <span class="crew"></span> with a <span class="gene"></span> other than Human, and such <span class="crew"></span> also remain non-Human. <strong><u><a href="#KW_Haumanit">Humaniti</a></u></strong> therefore qualify as both Human and non-Human.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Infamous"><strong><u>Infamous</u></strong></h4>
<p>While a card with this keyword is in play, its controlling captain is considered to have an additional <span class="infamy"></span> token.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Integral"><strong><u>Integral</u></strong></h4>
<p>A card with <strong><u><a href="#KW_Integral">Integral</a></u></strong> may not be moved, except to an out of play area, such as the hand, deck, dispersed region, or discard pile.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Invulnerable"><strong><u>Invulnerable (to x)</u></strong></h4>
<p>Cards with <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> cannot be affected by effects or cards of a specified type. <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> will always be paired with a specific identifier describing the nature of the immunity. A card’s Invulnerability will never extend to abilities it itself generates.</p>
<p>If a card is <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> to an effect, that effect may not:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Target <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> cards.</li>
    <li>Cancel or modify an effect generated by <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> cards.</li>
    <li>Attach to an <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> card.</li>
    <li>Change the <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> card’s game state, <span class="ready"></span> or <span class="exert"></span> the card, or move the card.</li>
    <li>Inflict <span class="wound"></span> or <span class="structure"></span>, Jettison or Disperse the <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> card.</li>
    <li>Change any value or attribute on the <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> card.</li>
    <li>Include the <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> card in any count. The <strong><u><a href="#KW_Invulnerable">Invulnerable</a></u></strong> card is invisible to the specified effect.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="KW_Mechanical"><strong><u>Mechanical</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong><u><a href="#KW_Mechanical">Mechanical</a></u></strong> <span class="crew"></span> may not have <span class="wound"></span> restored by crew abilities, <span class="gear"></span> or <span class="heroics"></span> unless the effect specifically indicates it will restore <span class="wound"></span> to Mechanical <span class="crew"></span>.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Reflec"><strong><u>Reflec</u></strong></h4>
<p>An <strong><u><a href="#KW_Armor">Armor</a></u></strong> source with this keyword ignores any <strong><u><a href="#KW_Armor_Penetration">Armor Penetration</a></u></strong> from a wounding source with <strong><i>Laser</i></strong>.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Replenish"><strong><u>Replenish (X)</u></strong></h4>
<p>For each point of <strong><u><a href="#KW_Replenish">Replenish</a></u></strong>, the effect’s controller moves a random card from their discard pile to the bottom of their deck. If instead the text states to “<strong><u><a href="#KW_Replenish">Replenish</a></u></strong> this card,” then rather than drawing a random card from the discard pile, the card with <strong><u><a href="#KW_Replenish">Replenish</a></u></strong> is moved to the bottom of the controller’s deck.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Resilient"><strong><u>Resilient</u></strong></h4>
<p>A <strong><u><a href="#KW_Resilient">Resilient</a></u></strong> card restores missing <span class="wound"></span> or <span class="structure"></span> during Stage 4 of the Ready Phase at no cost.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Restricted_Unrestricted"><strong><u>Restricted/Unrestrictd</u></strong></h4>
<p>Normally, a card with a given card title can only be included up to twice in an Adventure Deck or up to three times in a Captain’s Deck.  When a card has <strong><u><a href="#KW_Restricted_Unrestricted">Restricted (X)</a></u></strong>, it can only be included X number of times or fewer in the relevant deck.  So, <strong><u><a href="#KW_Restricted_Unrestricted">Restricted(2)</a></u></strong> for a Captain’s Deck card means at most two copies of that card in the Captain’s Deck. An <strong><u><a href="#KW_Restricted_Unrestricted">Unrestricted</a></u></strong> card may have any number of copies in a deck.</p>

<h4 id="KW_Trifling"><strong><u>Trifling</u></strong></h4>
<p>Trifling cards do not count against any limit restricting the number of cards a captain may have in play, and do not take up any slots. However, it still won’t permit a captain to control multiple <span class="crew"></span> with the same name.</p>

<h3 id="Jettison">Jettison</h3>
<p>Move the jettisoned card from play to the discard pile.</p>

<h3 id="Limited">Limited</h3>
<p>A limited effect may only be generated once each round. Limited is depicted with the icon <span class="limited"></span>.</p>

<h3 id="Look">Look</h3>
<p>Allows a captain to view a specified card (or cards) without revealing it (or them) to any other captain.</p>

<h3 id="Modifier">Modifier</h3>
<p>Any effect that increases or decreases any value of any card in play. Values in Traveller may be subject to either positive or negative modification. Fractional values are rounded up. Modifiers apply their full effect, even if that would reduce a value to less than zero. However, any value less than zero after all modifications have been applied counts as zero.</p>

<h3 id="Move">Move</h3>
<p>Alter the location of a card, between the play area, discard pile, deck, hand, or dispersed region.</p>

<h3 id="Native">Native</h3>
<p>Native refers to values, icons, text and attributes physically printed on the card.</p>

<h3 id="Non_Human">Non-Human</h3>
<p>A <span class="crew"></span> as non-Human if their <span class="gene"></span> any other than Human.</p>

<h3 id="Permanents">Permanents</h3>
<p>A permanent card has a persistent presence in the game play area, unless removed by an effect. <span class="conn"></span>, <span class="crew"></span>, <span class="gear"></span>, <span class="upgrade"></span> and <span class="ship"></span> are all permanents.</p>

<h3 id="Piracy">Piracy</h3>
<p>Captains who committed to piracy during the <a href="#Adventure_Phase">Adventure Phase</a> may resolve a piracy action by the following procedure:</p>
<ol>
    <li value="1">The acting captain targets a <span class="ship"></span> controlled by an opposing captain. The pirate is the “attacker,” the target the “defender.”</li>
    <li>The attacker inflicts damage equal to their Attack Value (<span class="attack"></span>), minus the defender’s Defense Value (<span class="defense"></span>). For each point of damage, the attacker assigns it either as <span class="structure"></span> inflicted on an <span class="upgrade"></span> attached to the defender, or as an expense the defender must meet.</li>
    <li>If the attacker inflicted damage (if their <span class="attack"></span> exceeded the defender’s <span class="defense"></span>), the piracy action is successful. If the attacker did not inflict damage, the piracy action was unsuccessful.</li>
    <li>The defender now inflicts damage equal to their <span class="attack"></span>, minus the attacker’s <span class="defense"></span>. For each point of damage, the defender assigns it in an identical manner as step 2. The defender’s damage, or lack thereof, has no impact on whether or not the piracy action succeeds (step 3).</li>
    <li>The pirate becomes uncommitted.</li>
</ol>
<p>When procuring cards during the <a href="#Procurement_Phase">Procurement Phase</a>, Captains must pay an additional <span class="1"></span> for each <span class="infamy"></span> token they possess.</p>

<h3 id="Ready">Ready(<span class="ready"></span>)</h3>
<p>Ready and Exerted are two game states indicating a card’s availability for further use.  Only cards currently in play may be <span class="ready"></span> or <span class="exert"></span> , and only a ready card may <span class="extert"></span>, while only an exerted card may <span class="ready"></span>. Ready cards are placed vertically so the text can be easily read.</p>

<h3 id="Restore">Restore</h3>
<p>Remove <span class="wound"></span> from a <span class="crew"></span> or <span class="structure"></span> from an <span class="upgrade"></span>.</p>

<h3 id="Search">Search</h3>
<p>When directed to search, a captain may select a card from the designated search location (typically either the captain’s or adventure decks or discard piles), reveal the selected card to all players, and then perform any further effects as may be pending.</p>

<h3 id="Skill_Levels">Skill Levels</h3>
<p>Skills come in two levels: Trained (hex) and Expert (circle). <span class="crew"></span> may only have a given skill at a single level. No <span class="crew"></span> may have a skill at both the trained (hex) and expert (circle) levels. <span class="crew"></span> with trained who gains expert (circle) just has the expert (circle). The expert (circle) level of a skill may always be used in place of the trained (hex). An expert (circle) skill token may be spent to meet a trained (hex) skill requirement or cost.</p>
<p>Some effects may grant a <span class="crew"></span> a specific skill level, rather than increase or decrease by levels.</p>

<h3 id="Target">Target</h3>
<p>Targeting is the act of identifying the specific subject or recipient of an effect. Targeting is an explicit concept. If an effect does not state the word “target,” that effect does not target. When targeting is required, captains must choose a legal target, if able. If an effect cannot find a legal target, the effect fails.</p>

<h3 id="Timing_Overview">Timing</h3>
<p>In customizable card games, timing is the framework that determines the order in which effects occur. <strong><i>Traveller</i></strong> uses a LIFO system, Last In, First Out. Effects are resolved in reverse order in which they are played. LIFO can sound counter-intuitive, but as a mechanic it allows players the opportunity to respond to changing circumstances.
<ul>
    <li><h4 id="The_Queue">The Queue</h4></li>
    <p>Whenever a card is played or an effect generated, it enters the queue. The queue is cleared by resolving effects in reverse order in which they were played. Once a queue has been formed, only cards and effects with <span class="reaction"></span> may be added to the queue.</p>
    <p>Most queues will only have a single item, and resolve without any further issues. However, the queue becomes relevant when captains wish to respond to an effect or card play</p>
    <li><h4 id="Activated_Effects">Activated Effects</h4></li>
    <p>An activated effect is any effect that requires a cost to be payed or a card play to generate. All transient cards are activated effects. Permanents also have activated effects, in the form of abilities that require a cost.</p>
    <p>Activated effects always go on the queue.</p>
    <li><h4 id="Persistent_Effects">Persistent Effects</h4></li>
    <p>An effect is persistent if it is generated by permanent cards from abilities that do not have a cost. Such effects are always active, unless subject to an unmet condition. Persistent effects do not enter the queue.</p>
    <li><h4 id="Priority">Priority</h4></li>
    <p>Priority identifies the captain with the initial opportunity to take an <span class="reaction"></span>, generate an effect, or play a card. Generally, priority rests with the acting captain. During phase stages in which there is no acting captain (for instance, Stage 1 Ready Phase), if two or more captains wish to play a card or generate an effect, priority is assigned to the captain with the highest <span class="initiative"></span>.</p>
    <li><h4 id="Phase_Restrictions">Phase Restrictions</h4></li>
    <p>Some effects may have certain limitations regarding the phase or phases in which they may be generated. These phase restrictions are displayed on the cards in blue outlined text. Any text below the phase restriction is subject to it.</p>
    <li><h4 id="Timing_Indicator">Timing Indicator</h4></li>
    <p>Text or icons preceding a dash (-) in a card’s text box determines an effect’s timing. There are two principle timing indicators in <strong><i>Traveller</i></strong>:
    <ul>
        <li><span class="action"></span>: This icon indicates that the effect is an action. <span class="action"></span> may only be generated by the acting captain.</li>
        <li><span class="react"></span> : This icon indicates that the effect is a reaction. Unlike other effects, <span class="reaction"></span> may be generated at any time, including while another effect is being resolved. Unless otherwise specified, all <span class="event"></span> cards are playable as <span class="react"></span>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>If an effect is not subject to either a phase restriction or <span class="action"></span> the timing indicator, then it may be generated at any time, provided no other effect is pending. Only effects with <span class="react"></span> timing may be played while another effect is on the queue.</p>
</ul>

<h3 id="Token">Token</h3>
<p>A token is a game play element with specified effects that do not depend on any other card, ability or effect. Common examples include Resource, Infamy (<span class="infamy"></span>) and <span class="victorypoint"></span> tokens.</p>

<h3 id="Trait">Trait</h3>
<p>A trait is a special characteristic of a card that lacks an independent effect, but may be implicated by other effects that reference the trait. Traits are always represented with <strong><i>bolded italic</i></strong> text.</p>

<h3 id="Transient">Transient</h3>
<p>Transient cards have a temporary presence in the game play area, existing only long enough to resolve any effects they may generate, after which they are moved out of play (typically to the discard pile). <span class="event"></span> and <span class="heroics"></span> are transient card types.</p>



<h1 id="Appendices">Appendices</h1>

<h2 id="Initial_Setup">Initial Setup</h2>
<p>To begin a game of <strong><em>Traveller</em></strong>, each captain must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Place their <span class="ship"></span> play.</li>
    <li>Shuffle their <a href="#Captains_Deck">Captain’s Deck</a>, then draw a hand of seven cards.</li>
    <li>Shuffle their <a href="#Adventure_Deck">Adventure Deck</a>, then draw a card from the deck and play it face up as a <span class="contract"></span>. Then draw another card and play it face down, without looking at it, attached to the <span class="contract"></span> as a <span class="complication"></span>. Repeat this step for each <span class="contract"></span> slot the captain controls. In a two-player game, each captain controls two <span class="contract"></span> slots.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2 id="Round_Sequence">Round Sequence</h2>
<p>A game of <strong><em>Traveller</em></strong> proceeds through rounds. Within each round, play progresses through six phases.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#Ready_Phase">Ready Phase</a></li>
    <li><a href="#Adventure_Phase">Adventure Phase</a></li>
    <li><a href="#Procurement_Phase">Procurement Phase</a></li>
    <li><a href="#Action_Phase">Action Phase</a></li>
    <li><a href="#Resource_Phase">Resource Phase</a></li>
    <li><a href="#Resolution_Phase">Resolution Phase</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Ready_Phase">Ready Phase</h3>
<p>The Ready Phase provides captains with an opportunity to reset their positions and plan their strategy for the upcoming round. Play proceeds through the following stages:</p>
<p>Stage 1: All captains simultaneously <span class="ready"></span> all exerted cards.</p>
<p>Stage 2: All captains simultaneously resolve to hand size by discarding any cards in hand in excess of their hand size, which by default is seven, then discarding any number of unwanted cards in their hands. Then drawing cards from the <a href="#Captains_Deck">Captain’s deck</a> until they reach their hand size limit. or until no more cards remain in the <a href="#Captains_Deck">captain’s deck</a>, whichever happens first.</p>
<p>Stage 3: Determine play order by comparing each captain’s <span class="initiative"></span>. The captain with the highest rating sets play order by choosing a first captain for the remainder of the round. If the <span class="initiative"></span> ratings are tied, determine the first captain randomly. When play occurs in “Initiative Order” it begins with the first captain, then proceeding clockwise. The “acting captain” is the player currently progressing through a stage.</p>
<p>Stage 4: In initiative order, captains may restore <span class="wound"></span> from <span class="crew"></span> and/or repair <span class="structure"></span> from <span class="upgrade"></span>, at a cost of <span class="1"></span> per point. Captains may elect to recover some or all of the <span class="wound"></span> or <span class="structure"></span>, at their discretion.</p>
<p>Stage 5: In initiative order, captains may move <span class="gear"></span> between <span class="crew"></span> they control. No <span class="gear"></span> may be moved more than once per Ready Phase. <span class="gear"></span> with <strong><u><a href="#KW_Integral">Integral</a></u></strong> (remember, all <strong><u><a href="#KW_Integral">Hindrances</a></u></strong> have <strong><u><a href="#KW_Integral">Integral</a></u></strong>) may not be moved.</p>
<p>Stage 6: Check for victory. If a captain has met their <span class="victorypoint"></span> threshold, which is 20 by default, they win the game. If multiple captains have exceeded their <span class="victorypoint"></span> threshold, the captain with the highest <span class="victorypoint"></span> wins. If there is a tie, then the captain with the highest <span class="initiative"></span> wins.</p>

<h3 id="Adventure_Phase">Adventure Phase</h3>
<p>During the Adventure Phase, captains play <span class="complication"></span> on <span class="contract"></span> and commit to an activity for the remainder of the round. Play proceeds through the following stages:</p>
<p>Stage 1: In initiative order, captains draw an adventure card, look at it without revealing it to opponents, then attach it face down on any <span class="contract"></span> in play as a <span class="complication"></span>. <span class="contract"></span> may not have more attached <span class="complication"></span> than permitted by its <span class="complication"></span> slots. If a new <span class="complication"></span> would exceed that limit, the acting captain must choose and discard an already attached <span class="complication"></span>to make room for the new one.</p>
<p>Stage 2: In initiative order, captains choose an activity to pursue from one of three options:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Uncommitted:</b> An uncommitted captain does not pursue any activity. If the captain was committed to a <span class="contract"></span>at the start of the phase, they may choose this activity, but must abandon the <span class="contract"></span> by paying the <span class="abandon"></span>.</li>
    <li><b>Pursue a <span class="contract"></span>:</b> This activity allows the captain to commit to a <span class="contract"></span>. Any captain may pursue any <span class="contract"></span>, regardless of <span class="contract"></span> slot control. A captain committed to a <span class="contract"></span> may elect to pursue a different <span class="contract"></span>, which will require abandoning the previous <span class="contract"></span>, by paying the <span class="abandon"></span>. Captains may also continue pursuing a <span class="contract"></span> they had previously committed to but had not yet resolved.</li>
    <lI>Any time a captain elects to pursue a new <span class="contract"></span>, they must cover the distance (<span class="distance"></span>). For a cost of <span class="1"></span>, a <span class="ship"></span> covers <span class="distance"></span> equal to its <span class="jump"></span>. Multiple jumps may be required to cover the distance.</lI>
    <li><b>Pursue Piracy:</b> Captains may declare as a pirate for a cost of <span class="1"></span>. Any captain declaring as a pirate gains an <span class="infamy"></span> token. Captains may engage in piracy even if currently committed to a <span class="contract"></span>, but they must abandon the by paying the <span class="abandon"></span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stage 3: Check for victory. If a captain has met their <span class="victorypoint"></span> threshold, which is 20 by default, they win the game. If multiple captains have exceeded their <span class="victorypoint"></span> threshold, the captain with the highest <span class="victorypoint"></span> wins. If there is a tie, then the captain with the highest <span class="initiative"></span> wins.</p>

<h4 id="Adventure_Phase_Solo">Solo Play Adventure Phase</h4>
<p>Because <span class="complication"></span> are the primary obstacle in solo play, the <a href="#Adventure_Phase">Adventure Phase</a> has a number of important changes.</p>
<p>Stage 1:	 The captain draws an adventure card and, without looking at it, plays it face down as a <span class="complication"></span>, using the following steps to determine the <span class="contract"></span> to which it should attach.</p>
<ul>
<li type="A">Attach it to the <span class="contract"></span> with the highest <span class="victorypoint"></span> unless that <span class="contract"></span> already has a number of attached <span class="complication"></span> equal to its <span class="complication"></span> slots, in which case, attach it to the <span class="contract"></span> with the next highest <span class="victorypoint"></span>.</li>
<li type="A">If all <span class="contract"></span> already have a number of attached <span class="complication"></span> equal to their <span class="complication"></span> slots, then attach it to the <span class="contract"></span> with the lowest <span class="victorypoint"></span> total, after choosing an already attached <span class="complication"></span> to move to the discard pile.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stage 2: The captain draws an adventure card and places it face up as a <span class="complication"></span> on a <span class="contract"></span> of their choosing.</p>
<p>Stage 3: Choosing an Activity to Pursue, Because Piracy is not an option, captains must choose between pursing a <span class="contract"></span> or being uncommitted.</p>
<p>Stage 4: Check for victory. If a captain has met their <span class="victorypoint"></span> threshold, which is 20 by default, they win the game.</p>


<h3 id="Procurement_Phase">Procurement Phase</h3>
<p>In the Procurement Phase, captains have the opportunity to hire <span class="crew"></span>, equip <span class="gear"></span>, forge <span class="connection"></span> and install <span class="upgrade"></span>.</p>
<p>Stage 1: In initiative order, captains put <span class="connection"></span>, <span class="crew"></span>, <span class="gear"></span> and <span class="upgrade"></span> into play (“procure”) from their hand by paying the card’s cost. When procuring cards during this phase, Captains must pay an additional <span class="1"></span> for each <span class="infamy"></span> token they possess.</p>
<p><span class="connection"></span> and <span class="crew"></span> are placed directly into play. <span class="upgrade"></span> are attached to the procuring captain’s <span class="ship"></span>. <span class="gear"></span> are attached to a <span class="crew"></span> controlled by the procuring captain. <span class="gear"></span> or <span class="upgrade"></span> with the <strong><u><a href="#KW_Hindrance">Hindrance</a></u></strong> keyword may instead be played on a card controlled by an opposing captain.</p>
<p>Some card types have certain limits that constrain the number that a captain may have in play.</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed text-center">
    <tr class="bg-baratheon">
        <th>Card Limits*</th><th></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><em>Connection(<span class="connection"></span>)</em></td><td>No more than one of each subtyle</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="bg-info">
        <td><em>Crew(<span class="crew"></span>)</em></td><td>No more than the <span class="crew"></span> slots provided by the captain's <span class="ship"></span>. <span class="crew"></span> are unique. No captain may have more than one <span class="crew"></span> with the same name, but multiple captains may each have a copy of the same <span class="crew"></span>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><em>Gear(<span class="gear"></span>)</em></td><td>No <span class="crew"></span> may have attached more than one of each subtype.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="bg-info">
        <td><em>Upgrade(<span class="upgrade"></span>)</em></td><td>No more than the subtype slots provided by the captain's <span class="ship"></span></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>Anytime a captain would control cards in excess of any limit, that captain must choose and jettison cards until within permissible amounts. Cards with the keyword <strong><u><a href="#KW_Trifling">Trifling</a></u></strong> do not count against slot limits. See the <strong><u><a href="#KW_Trifling">Trifling</a></u></strong> entry in the keyword glossary for more details.</p>
<p>Stage 2: Check for victory. If a captain has met their <span class="victorypoint"></span> threshold, which is 20 by default, they win the game. If multiple captains have exceeded their <span class="victorypoint"></span> threshold, the captain with the highest <span class="victorypoint"></span> wins. If there is a tie, then the captain with the highest <span class="initiative"></span> wins.</p>

<h3 id="Action_Phase">Action Phase</h3>
<p>During the Action Phase, captains have the opportunity to improve their position and hinder their opponents.</p>
<p>Stage 1: Captains alternate in initiative order performing actions. Actions are denoted by <span class="action"></span>. Some <span class="gear"></span> may provide Use actions, indicated by the <span class="use"></span> icon. <span class="use"></span> is always an <span class="action"></span>, and it requires the <span class="crew"></span> acting to <span class="icon-exert"></span>.</p>
<p><span class="heroics"></span> are a special kind of <span class="action"></span> available to <span class="crew"></span> with the requisite skill. When declaring a <span class="crew"></span> is performing a <span class="heroics"></span>, the controlling captain must choose whether the acting <span class="crew"></span> is taking the trained or the expert <span class="action"></span>. A trained <span class="crew"></span> may only select the trained <span class="action"></span>. An expert <span class="crew"></span> may perform either, but not both.</p>
<p>The expert level of some <span class="heroics"></span> may say “as above,” with or without additional text. As above indicates that the trained level text is applied, subject to any other modifying language in the expert ability.</p>
<p>Captains may play cards, use non-action abilities or generate effects even if they are not the current active captain. However, no card or ability may be played during an <span class="action"></span> unless that card or ability has reaction (<span class="react"></span>).</p>
<p>The active captain may pass, if so desired. If all captains pass in order, the phase ends. If one captain passes and another acts, any previously passing captain may act.</p>
<p>Stage 2: Check for victory. If a captain has met their <span class="victorypoint"></span> threshold, which is 20 by default, they win the game. If multiple captains have exceeded their <span class="victorypoint"></span> threshold, the captain with the highest <span class="victorypoint"></span> wins. If there is a tie, then the captain with the highest <span class="initiative"></span> wins.</p>

<h3 id="Resource_Phase">Resource Phase</h3>
<p>In the Resource Phase, captains generate tokens for use in resolving <span class="contract"></span> and <span class="complication"></span>.</p>
<p>Stage 1: In initiative order, captains collect all resource tokens to which they are entitled. In <strong><em>Traveller</em></strong>, there are two kinds of resource tokens: Capabilities and skills.</p>
<ul>
<li>A captain’s <span class="ship"></span> generates one capability token for each capability icon it possesses.</li>
<li>Each <span class="crew"></span> controlled by the captain generates one skill token for each skill it possesses. Skills come in two levels, trained (hex) and expert (circle). A <span icon="crew"></span> generates the skill token that corresponds to the level it possesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Resource tokens from a captain’s <span class="ship"></span> and <span class="crew"></span> are generated automatically, and are collected into the captain’s Resource Pool without any further act by the captain. A captain need not remember to physically gather the tokens. A captain may voluntarily reject any token from entering their Resource Pool, but must do so explicitly. If any effect requires a captain to pay a cost or resolve an effect to collect a token, that captain must explicitly elect to pay the cost or resolve the effect.</p>
<p>Stage 2: Check for victory. If a captain has met their <span class="victorypoint"></span> threshold, which is 20 by default, they win the game. If multiple captains have exceeded their <span class="victorypoint"></span> threshold, the captain with the highest <span class="victorypoint"></span> wins. If there is a tie, then the captain with the highest <span class="initiative"></span> wins.</p>

<h3 id="Resolution_Phase">Resolution Phase</h3>
<p>The Resolution Phase is, in many ways, the culmination of a captain’s efforts. During this part of the round, players attempt to resolve <span class="contract"></span> and piracy, in the hopes of advancing towards victory.</p>
<p>Stage 1: All captains simultaneously reveal all face down <span class="complication"></span> on a <span class="contract"></span> they are pursuing.</p>
<p>Stage 2: Captains alternate in initiative order performing one of the following <a href="#Resolution_Phase">Resolution Phase</a> actions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A captain pursuing a <span class="contract"></span> with attached <span class="complication"></span> may attempt to resolve a <span class="complication"></span>.</li>
    <li>A captain declared as a pirate may resolve a piracy attempt.</li>
<li>A captain may pass. Captains who pass may make no further selections during this stage. Note, this is different from the procedure during the <a href="#Action_Phase">Action Phase</a>, where captains are allowed to act after passing if another captain has subsequently acted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once all captains have passed, the stage ends. If a captain is pursuing a <span class="contract"></span>, and that <span class="contract"></span> has no attached <span class="complication"></span> at the time the captain passes, that captain is an “eligible” captain. If a captain is pursuing a <span class="contract"></span>, and that <span class="contract"></span> does have attached <span class="complication"></span> at the time the captain passes, that captain is “ineligible.”</p>
<p><span class="complication"></span> <strong>Resolution:</strong> Captains committed to <span class="contract"></span> may attempt to resolve any attached <span class="complication"></span> by the following procedure:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select an attached <span class="complication"></span>. All <span class="complication"></span> on pursued should already have been revealed, but if, for some reason, the <span class="complication"></span> has not been revealed, reveal it.</li>
    <li><span class="complication"></span> are resolved by meeting its requirements. Requirements displaying a Resource Token icon are resolved if the captain can discard the corresponding token from their Resource pool. Alternatively, some requirements obligate the captain to jettison cards or incur expenses. Finally, requirements that simply state a card type or attribute (such as a <strong><em>trait</em></strong>) but do not specify any other obligation (such as jettison, <span class="exert"></span>, etc) can be met if the captain controls the corresponding card or a card with the specified attribute.</li>
    <li>If a <span class="complication"></span> has multiple requirements, resolve each one individually. <span class="complication"></span> are resolved only if all requirements are met.</li>
    <li>If the <span class="complication"></span> is resolved, the acting captain may then attempt to resolve any subplots (<span class="subplot"></span>) on the <span class="complication"></span> by meeting its requirements. If a <span class="subplot"></span> has multiple requirements, resolve each one individually. <span class="subplot"></span> are only resolved if all requirements are met. Some <span class="subplot"></span> may have elective requirements, in which case the acting captain must choose one to fulfill. If there are multiple <span class="subplot"></span>, the acting captain may attempt to resolve some, all, or none at their election. If a <span class="subplot"></span> is resolved, the acting captain claims the <span class="subplot"></span> award.</li>
    <li>If the is resolved, move it to its owner’s adventure discard pile. Unresolved remain attached.</li>
    <li>If the acting captain resolved the <span class="complication"></span>, they may make further selections later during the <a href="#Resolution_Phase">Resolution Phase</a>. If the acting captain failed to resolve the <span class="complication"></span>, they are treated as though they had passed, and may make no further selections during the rest of the phase, and are counted ineligible.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Passing:</strong> A committed captain may elect to pass, rather than attempt to resolve a <span class="complication"></span> or piracy. Captains who pass in the <a href="#Resolution_Phase">Resolution Phase</a> may make no further selections for the remainder of the phase. If a captain passes while pursuing a <span class="contract"></span>, and that <span class="contract"></span> has no attached <span class="complication"></span>, they are “eligible.” If the captain passes while pursuing a <span class="complication"></span>, and that <span class="contract"></span> has one or more attached <span class="complication"></span>, the captain is “ineligible.”</p>
<p>Once all captains have passed, the stage ends.</p>
<p>Stage 3: In initiative order, eligible captains may attempt to resolve <span class="contract"></span> the they are pursuing.</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="contract"></span> are resolved by meeting its requirements. Requirements displaying a Resource Token icon are resolved if the captain can discard the corresponding token from their Resource pool. Alternatively, some requirements obligate the captain to jettison cards or incur expenses. Finally, requirements that simply state a card type or attribute (such as a <strong><em>trait</em></strong>) but do not specify any other obligation (such as jettison, <span class="exert"></span>, etc) can be met if the captain controls the corresponding card or a card with the specified attribute.</li>
    <li>If a <span class="contract"></span> has multiple requirements, resolve each one individually. <span class="contract"></span> are resolved only if all requirements are met. If the <span class="contract"></span> has been resolved, the acting captain claims the <span class="contract"></span><span class="victorypoint"></span>.</li>
    <li>If the <span class="contract"></span> is resolved, the acting captain may then attempt to resolve any <span class="subplot"></span> on the <span class="contract"></span> by meeting its requirements. If a <span class="subplot"></span> has multiple requirements, resolve each one individually. <span class="subplot"></span> are only resolved if all requirements are met. Some <span class="subplot"></span> may have elective requirements, in which case the acting captain must choose one to fulfill. If there are multiple <span class="subplot"></span>, the acting captain may attempt to resolve some, all, or none at their election. If a <span class="subplot"></span> is resolved, the acting captain claims the <span class="subplot"></span> award.</li>
    <li>If the <span class="contract"></span> is resolved, move it to its owner’s adventure discard pile. Then, the owner of the <span class="contract"></span> slot draws an adventure card and plays it, face up, as a <span class="contract"></span>. They then draw another adventure card and, without looking at it, attaches it face down on the new <span class="contract"></span> as a <span class="complication"></span>. If the <span class="contract"></span> was not resolved, it remains in play.</li>
    <li>If the <span class="contract"></span> was resolved, the acting captain becomes uncommitted. If the <span class="contract"></span> was not resolved, the acting captain remains committed to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stage 4: Any captain who did not conduct a piracy action during the round loses 1 <span class="infamy"></span> token. Even if a captain declared as a pirate during the <a href="#Adventure_Phase">Adventure Phase</a>, they will still lose an <span class="infamy"></span> token if they did not actually conduct a piracy action at any point during the round.</p>
<p>Stage 5: All captains discard any remaining tokens in their Resource Pool.</p>
<p>Stage 6: Check for victory. If a captain has met their <span class="victorypoint"></span> threshold, which is 20 by default, they win the game. If multiple captains have exceeded their <span class="victorypoint"></span> threshold, the captain with the highest <span class="victorypoint"></span> wins. If there is a tie, then the captain with the highest <span class="initiative"></span> wins.</p>
<p>After <em>Stage 6</em> of the <a href="#Resolution_Phase">Resolution Phase</a>, the round ends. If nobody has won, begin a new round by repeating the phases, and continue the sequence until a victor has been determined.</p>

<p><strong>Piracy:</strong> Captains who committed to piracy during the <a href="#Adventure_Phase">Adventure Phase</a> may resolve a piracy action by the following procedure:</p>
<ol>
    <li value="1">The acting captain targets a <span class="ship"></span> controlled by an opposing captain. The pirate is the “attacker,” the target the “defender.”</li>
    <li>The attacker inflicts damage equal to their Attack Value (<span class="attack"></span>), minus the defender’s Defense Value (<span class="defense"></span>). For each point of damage, the attacker assigns it either as <span class="structure"></span> inflicted on an <span class="upgrade"></span> attached to the defender, or as an expense the defender must meet.</li>
    <li>If the attacker inflicted damage (if their <span class="attack"></span> exceeded the defender’s <span class="defense"></span>), the piracy action is successful. If the attacker did not inflict damage, the piracy action was unsuccessful.</li>
    <li>The defender now inflicts damage equal to their <span class="attack"></span>, minus the attacker’s <span class="defense"></span>. For each point of damage, the defender assigns it in an identical manner as step 2. The defender’s damage, or lack thereof, has no impact on whether or not the piracy action succeeds (step 3).</li>
    <li>The pirate becomes uncommitted.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Actions in the <a href="#Resolution_Phase">Resolution Phase</a></strong></p>
<p>Some cards may be played as <span class="action"></span> an during the <a href="#Resolution_Phase">Resolution Phase</a>. A captain may play such an <span class="action"></span> instead of conducting piracy or resolving a <span class="complication"></span>.</p>
<p>Note, however, that a captain who plays an <span class="action"></span> may resolve a <span class="complication"></span> or conduct piracy when they next become the acting captain.</p>
<p>Because uncommitted captains may not resolve <span class="complication"></span> or conduct piracy, as a practical matter their only available selections as the active captain are either a <a href="#Resolution_Phase">Resolution Phase</a> action, or passing.</p>
