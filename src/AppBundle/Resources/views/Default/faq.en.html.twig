<h1 id="Notes_and_Errata">Notes and Errata</h1>

<p>This section contains notes and errata pertaining to specific cards or sections of the rulebook. The document version number in which an entry first appeared is listed with that entry in order to establish a history of when each change was made.<p>

<p>Errata overrides the originally printed information on the card it applies to. Unless errata for a card appears below, the original English non-draft product printing of that card and all of its information is considered accurate, and overrides all other printings. This includes translated cards, promotional or organized play cards, and printings which may appear in alternate products.</p>

<p><strong>Buccaneer</strong> <span class="Ship"></span> (<span class="Attack"></span>: 1, <span class="Defense"></span>:1, <span class="Structure"></span>:1) for any attribute not mentioned, you can always assume a value of 0, like <span class="Initiative"></span>: 0. When a complication buccaneer does damage to you, always assign that damage as an expense<span class="Expense"></span></p>

<p><span class="new">Play at the start of the phase.</span> Until end of phase, <span class="new">whenever any</span> captain expends a card, if the expended card shares a trait with a card controlled by that Captain, it is worth <span class="ev"></span>+1.</p>

<h3><strong>The Tigress’s Wake</strong></h3>
<p><span class="new">Play at the start of the phase.</span> Remove from play all <span class="contract"></span>, then replace as normal. Until the end of the round, any Captain of an <strong><em>Imperial</em></strong> gains 1<span class="vp"></span> for completing a <span class="contract"></span>.</p>

<h2 id="Card_Clarifications"><em>Clarifications</em></h2>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Advanced Solutions, Inc.</strong></h3>
<p>So in the Adventure Phase, Stage 1, you get to draw one complication and look at it without revealing it to your opponents, and then play it on one of the the contracts. With this card, if you exert it, you get to draw two cards instead. IN SOLO PLAY, Stage 1, you draw one complication and play it face down. However, in Stage 2, you get to draw an adventure card and place it face up. So with ASI, you get to draw two and decide which to play. Since there is no Phase Restriction, you can also use it during other times when you're required to draw from the adventure deck.</p>

<h3><strong>Contingency</strong></h3>
<p>The captain leaves the <span class="Event"></span> attached to the <span class="Crew"></span> until it is played, at which point, as a cost, the <span class="Crew"></span> is returned to the captain's hand and the <span class="Event"></span> is played for <span class="Cost0"></span>. The <span class="Event"></span> may be played at any time it would otherwise have been eligible if it had been played normally. So an <span class="Event"></span> with a Phase Restriction can still only be played in the appropriate phase. Note, there's nothing to stop you from playing the <span class="Event"></span> immediately, if no other condition prevents it.</p>
<p>So Contingency serves three separate, but related purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>It lets you search for an <span class="Event"></span>, which can be a handy way to solve a particular problem.</li>
<li>You have <span class="UnderworldExpert"></span>, you can get an <span class="Event"></span> from your discard pile, so if you ended up expending it for <span class="Expense"></span> or using it, you can get it back.</li>
<li>It reduces the cost to :credit0 by returning the attached :crew. Of course, you'd have to pay to bring that :crew out again if you wanted to, but there are instances where bringing a card back to your hand may be advantageous. For instance, if they have an ability that generates on being played...</li>
</ol>


<h3><strong>Fatimah Noori</strong></h3>
<p>Fatimah's <span class="Action"></span> to gain <span class="UnderworldExpert"></span> upgrades her <span class="UnderworldTrained"></span>skill. You do not get both skills at the same time.</p>

<h3><strong>Lt. Cmdr Sir Sandar van Othlezee</strong></h3>
<p>Some versions have the keyword <strong><u><a href="../rulesreference#KW_Replenish">REPLENISH</a></u></strong> printed in <strong><em>trait</em></strong> format, as <strong><em>Replenish</em></strong>. Both versions of the card use the <strong><u><a href="../rulesreference#KW_Replenish">REPLENISH</a></u></strong> mechanic, and the <strong><u>underline bold</u></strong> format is correct.</p>

<h3><strong>Mark Appleton</strong></h3>
<p>Mark’s ability allowing his controller to jettison him for 3<span class="ev"></span> permits the captain to expend him to meet an expense, as though Mark were a card in hand.</p>

<h3><strong>Ranke’s Razor</strong></h3>
<p>Captains may only select Captain’s Card types, and are forbidden from selecting either a <span class="contract"></span> or a <span class="complication"></span>.

<h3><strong>Reliance on Professionals</strong></h3>
<p>The requirement <em>added</em> by <strong>Reliance on Professionals</strong> can be met by any skill token of the requisite level. The reference to “any Trained Skill” and “any Expert Skill” does not allow the controller to name a skill of choice, but rather indicates that any skill token is sufficient to meet the requirement.</p>

<h3><strong>The Pretty Penny</strong></h3>
<p>Reference to “Ship card” should be treated the same as if it displayed the <span class="ship"></span> icon.</p>

<h3><strong>There's Always Something...</strong></h3>
<p>When you choose to encounter and resolve this complication, you choose a Captain's adventure deck - that's the target. So, in a four-player game, you could pick any of the four adventure decks to reveal the top 5 cards and attach 2 of those cards. Now, the question as to how it works when there are already other complications came up in today's tournament at DunDraCon. We may review the ruling to make sure it it consistent, but here's how it worked today.</p>
<p>Contract has 2 complications and a limit of 2, one of which is this one:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the captain removes the other complication, leaving only this one, then this complication is encountered, it is on the way to the discard pile as it's being resolved to where two of the five revealed complications are added to the contract.</li>
	<li>If the captain resolves this complication first, the five complications are revealed and one of them will definitely be added to the contract as this complication is no longer considered attached while it's being resolved. A second complication from the five revealed may be chosen to replace the other, original complication or the other four cards revealed may be discarded if the captain resolving "There is Always Something ..." would rather not replace the other, original complication.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id=""Search_Key>Search Shortcuts</h1>
	<p>
		Since I removed the search modal that pops up and lists the short handed key, I am going to post it here as it is very quick and easy way to get really advanced search results:
		All of these are typed directly into the search box:
		<ul>
		<li> : Default search is Captain's Deck card name. For Adventure Cards, the <span class="contract"></span> name is searched. String/Text</li>
		<li>'': Searches the card code, this is the sites internal card numbers, since <strong><em>TravellerCCG</em></strong> does not have card numbers. Integer</li>
		<li>a: Searches the <em>flavor</em> text. String/Text</li>
		<li>b: Searches <span class="complication"></span><span class="abandonment"></span> modifier, Adventure Cards only, may be negative. Integer</li>
		<li>c: Returns all of the cards in the cycle. Cycles are usually sets of releases of cards.  At the moment, not sure how this is going to be implemented in the future, everything currently is in the Initial Launch cycle. String/Text</li>
		<li>d: Searches Adventure Cards for <span class="contract"></span><span class="distance"></span>. Integer </li>
		<li>e: Returns all of the cards in a pack. This can be combined with other searches to limit card pools to just these packs of cards. String/Text</li>
		<li>f: This is a list of the Ships, which is a quick way to return them. Each ship is setup as its own color branding / faction. Every other card not a ship is listed under Neutral. Cards that can only be used by specific ships are assigned to their ship faction. String/Text</li>
		<li>g: Searches the <span class="complication"></span> name. Only searches Adventure Cards. String/Text</li>
		<li>h: Searches the Adventure Cards for <span class="complication"></span> requirements. String/Text</li>
		<li>i: Searches the illustrator's name. String/Text</li>
		<li>j: Searches <span class="contract"></span><span class="complication"></span> slots for quantity. Integer</li>
		<li>k: Searches all of the card <strong><em>traits</em></strong>, currently does <em>NOT</em> search <span class="complication"></span> traits. String/Text</li>
		<li>l: Searches <span class="contract"></span> for <span class="abandonment"></span> penalty. Integer</li>
		<li>m: Searches Adventure Cards for <span class="contract"></span> requirements. String/Text</li>
		<li>n: Searches card's <span class="expenses"></span>, also supports < or >. Integer</li>
		<li>o: Searches card's Cost, also supports < or >. Integer</li>
		<li>p: Reserved for Pagination</li>
		<li>q: Reserved for Query Code</li>
		<li>r: Searches cards based on date released. Date Format</li>
		<li>s: Searches Adventure Card <span class="contract"></span><span class="subplot"></span> for requirements. String/Text</li>
		<li>t: Searches cards based on type (adv, conn, gear, ship, heroic, crew, upgrade, event, ship). String/Text</li>
		<li>u: Searches <span class="crew"></span> skills. String/Text</li>
		<li>v: Searches Adventure Cards for <span class="contract"></span><span class="vp"></span> points. Integer</li>
		<li>w: Searches <span class="crew"></span> cards based on <span class="wounds"></span>. Integer</li>
		<li>x: Searches the cards Text box area. Does <em>NOT</em> search Adventure Cards. String/Text</li>
		<li>y: </li>
		<li>z: </li>
		</ul>
		So the real power comes in with combining search function like, if you wanted all of the 0 cost cards with an <span class="expenses"></span> > 0.  Which in the search box you would enter o:0 n>0. Or you say you have a great card that you want to play that needs an Aslan, k:Aslan.
